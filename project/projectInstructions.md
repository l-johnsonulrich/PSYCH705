# Independent Coding Project Instructions

## Overview
Near the end of the semester, you will complete an **independent coding project** and present your results to the class, simulating a **scientific conference presentation**.  

This project is your opportunity to:
- Apply the tools and methods you’ve learned in class.
- Work with real scientific data.
- Practice open, reproducible coding practices.
- Communicate your findings effectively to your peers.

Your project will consist of two parts:
1. A **GitHub repository** containing your code, analyses, and documentation.  
2. A **conference-style presentation** (PowerPoint) summarizing your work.

## Project Requirements

### Data
- You may use **your own research data**, data from your lab (ask your PI or labmates), or **open-access data** from an online publication or repository. Many publications will have links to their data in the manuscripts. 
- Cite your data source clearly in your README and presentation.  

### Code
Your final code should demonstrate the **full pipeline** of data science skills covered in class:
1. **Data Import** – Load raw data from a file, API, or repository.  
2. **Data Cleaning/Processing** – Handle missing values, outliers, or reformatting.  
3. **Statistical Analysis** – Apply appropriate methods for your question. Show how you checked assumptions and model fit.  
4. **Visualization** – Produce clear, publication-quality figures to support your conclusions.  

>  *Code does not have to be “perfect,” but it should be functional, reproducible, and show growth from your initial proposal to the final version.*

## GitHub Usage

- **Push your code regularly** throughout the semester (not just at the end).  
  - Frequent commits will serve as evidence of steady progress.  
- Include the following in your repo:
  - `README.md` (with project description, data source, and instructions to run your code)  
  - Scripts and HTML output (`.Rmd`, `.html`)  
  - A copy of your **final presentation** (in `.pptx` or `.pdf` format)

## Project Proposal (Due **Tuesday, November 11th before class**)

Submit a **short project proposal** (~1 page). This should include:
- **Topic & Question**: What scientific question are you asking? What are your hypotheses and predictions?  
- **Data Source**: Where will the data come from?  
- **Methods**: What kinds of analyses or tools do you anticipate using?  
- **Expected Outcomes**: What do you hope to learn?  

The proposal is graded and will be the starting point for your GitHub repo.

## Final Deliverables & Deadlines

- **Final Code & Repository** – due **Monday, December 15th at 11:59 PM**  
- **Final Presentation** – given in class **Tuesday, December 16th**  

### Presentation Requirements
- **Length**: 5 minutes + 1-2 minutes for questions  
- **Slide(s) must include**:  
  1. **Background**: Scientific context and why the question matters  
  2. **Hypotheses**: What you predicted before analyzing  
  3. **Methods**: Data source, coding workflow, and analyses used  
  4. **Results**: Key figures, tables, and findings  
  5. **Conclusions**: Interpret results, note limitations, and suggest next steps

> These presentations are similar to "lightning talks" at scientific conferences. You can have multiple slides OR create a single slide poster style.

## Tips for Success
- **Start early**: Pick a dataset and topic you care about.  
- **Commit often**: Small, regular pushes are better than one big upload.  
- **Document your process**: Write clear comments and update your README as you go.  
- **Seek feedback**: Use office hours and peer discussions to troubleshoot.  
- **Practice your talk**: Time yourself and refine your slides for clarity.
