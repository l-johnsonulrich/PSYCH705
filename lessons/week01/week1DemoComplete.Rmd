Pre R Studio Demo in R: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
1 #print 1
1+1 #print 1+1 =2 
a #gives error because it thinks characters refer to 'objects'
2*2 #print 2*2 = 4
a <- 1 #this is a numeric variable 
a #print a
a*3 #print a*3 = 3
a+5 #print a+5 = 6

b <- "Hi" #this is a character variable 
b #print b

a+b #error

class(a) #a is numeric
class(b) #b is character 

#create a vector (feed in some data!)
vec <- c(3,6,9,12) #create a numeric vector (a dataset) with the values 1,2,3,4 
vec #print the vector
vec[1] #display the first element in the vector 
vec[2:4] #display the 2nd through the 4th element in the vector
vec[c(1,4)] #display the first and the last element in the vector
c(1,4) #what does c(1,4) print?
vec[vec > 6] #use a logical rule to just show elements greater than 6 
vec + 2 #add 2 to every value in the vector
vec <- vec + 2 #save this change

#move to R studio 
```

## 1. Coding in R Studio 
You can type R code straight into the Console just like in R. The Console is located in the bottom left pane of R Studio. Also find the Workspace in the top right under a tab called "Environment". You can find your Files, Plots, Packages, and Help tabs in the bottom right. 

In addition to typing code into the Console, you can run code that you've already written or saved by highlighting it and hitting command-enter. OR just hitting command-enter alone will run the line of code that you are on. 


## 2. Markdown Syntax Cheatsheet 
R Markdown (File.Rmd) is a way of writing HTML or PDF files. It lets you combine narrative text, R code, and code output into a single document. This is especially useful because it allows you to: 

* Document your analysis alongside your code
* Produce reproducible reports in HTML, PDF, or Word
* Include headings, lists, links, images, and formatting to make your results clear
* Easily share your workflow with others while keeping code and outputs together 

Note: R scripts (File.R) are also useful for writing code if you want to run that code remotely when using big data and computationally heavy analyses.

## 3. Coding in R Studio

---

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# R code goes here. 

a <- 3 # create a variable named a that contains one element "3"
a*2  # multiple the variable by 2 (and print it)

#knit reads the code "from scratch" without access to your workspace. 
newVec
 
```

- `{r ...}` — this tells R Markdown it’s an R code chunk.  
- `chunk_name` — optional; gives the chunk a name (like `cars`) to identify it. Useful for debugging or referencing plots.  
- Options control **visibility and evaluation**.

#### **Common chunk options**

| Option | Values | What it does |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| `echo` | `TRUE`/`FALSE` | Show/hide the code in the final output. |
| `eval` | `TRUE`/`FALSE` | Run or skip the code when knitting. |
| `include` | `TRUE`/`FALSE` | Show code and output or hide both (good for setup chunks). |
| `message` | `TRUE`/`FALSE` | Show/hide messages generated by functions (like `library()` messages). |
| `warning` | `TRUE`/`FALSE` | Show/hide warnings. |
| `fig.width`, `fig.height` | numeric | Set size of plots. |
| `results` | `"markup"` / `"hide"` | Show/hide printed output. |

### **Dataframes, indexing, and generating numbers**

```{r dataframes}
# This chunk is named "dataframes". 

#create a dataframe 
df <- data.frame(
  id = 1:3,
  species = c("dog", "cat", "fish"), 
  name = c("Scout", "Leo", "Nemo"), 
  age = c("4", "16", "1"))
#this dataframe has three columns and three rows 
df #print the dataframe
df$species #print the species column 
df$name #print the name column
df$age #print the age column 
df[1] #print the first column
df[3] #print the 3rd column 
df[4] #error no 4th column 
df["species"] #print the species column 

df[1,] #print the first row 
df[1,] #print the second row 

df[,3] #print the third column 

df[2,3] #print a single cell 
df[2, "name"] #print row 2, name column 


#we can also work with characters

x <- "blue" #a single item variable 
x
y <- c("hyena", "meerkat", "horse") #a character vector 
y

#we can use paste to print multiple character or numeric values together 
paste(x,y)
paste0(x,y)
paste(x, y[1])
paste(x, y[2], "pup", 3)


```
