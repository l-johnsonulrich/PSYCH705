## In-Class Activities
1. RStudio basics: creating objects, data types, indexing.  
2. Demonstration of R scripts vs R Markdown.  
3. GitHub setup:  
    - Clone your personal repo  
    - Make your first commit and push
    - Share the repo with your instructor  
4. First reproducible script: create a simple dataset with numbers and 
text and push to GitHub at 5 times while making edits.

> **Tip:** Type along with the demo — don’t copy-paste blindly. Practicing 
typing builds muscle memory in R.
