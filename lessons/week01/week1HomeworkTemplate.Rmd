1. For this week's homework please go through the swirl tutorial **1.1.1** and **1.1.3**. 

1. R Programming: The basics of programming R
    1. R Programming
        1. Basic Building Blocks
        3. Sequences of Numbers

To get started, install and open the swirl package. While base R lets you do quite a bit of coding, "R packages" are tools created by others that have more functions than just base R. Let's start by installing and running our first package "R Swirl" which will run an R tutorial in the Console. The code to install and run swirl is below. Note that Swirl will run in just the console. After you've done 1.1.1 and 1.1.3 there are some exercises for you to do below. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}

install.packages('swirl')

library(swirl)

```
Note: You do NOT need to recieve credit on Coursera.org.
