# Week 2 – Importing, Cleaning, & Visualization of Data

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1. Use GitHub to manage and share your code. 
2. Explore and wrangle data in R using tidyverse. 
3. Visualize data using ggplot2.

## 🐙 Part 1: GitHub Setup and Practice

### Step 1. Create a GitHub repository
- Log into [GitHub](https://github.com).  
- Create a **new repository** called `PSYCH705` (or something similar).  
- Set it to **private** and **initialize with a README**.

### Step 2. Share the repo with me
- Go to your repo’s **Settings → Collaborators**.  
- Add my GitHub username so I can view your work.  

### Step 3. Clone the repo to your computer. 
- In RStudio use the Terminal to "clone" (i.e. download) the repo.
- Paste the repository URL and choose a folder on your computer.  

### Step 4. Push your work
- Copy last week’s files into this folder.  
- Save your in-class work from today into this folder.  
- Use **Git → Commit → Push** to upload your changes.

## 📊 Part 2: R Practice with airquality & ChickWeight

This week’s R Markdown `Week2DemoTidyR.Rmd` and `week02inClassExerciseTemplate.Rmd` will walk you through:

- Viewing the built-in dataset `ChickWeight` 
- Converting datasets to tibbles with `as_tibble()`
- Summarizing it with `summary()`  
- Cleaning messy dataframes with `messy_airquality.csv`
- Creating a new dataset with `mutate()`  
- Filtering subsets with `filter()`  
- Making simple plots witth `ggplot()`

---

## 📂 Files in this folder

- `messy_airquality.csv` – in-class demo data file  
- `week02inClassExerciseTemplate.Rmd` – practice file to complete in class.  
- `week02homeworkTemplate.Rmd` – practice file to complete for homework.  
- `README.md` – this file.  

---

## ✅ Homework

1. Open `week02homeworkTemplate.Rmd`.  
2. Complete the exercises (summary stats, filtering, plots, etc.).  
3. Knit to HTML.  
4. Commit and push your homework (both the .Rmd and .html) to your GitHub repo **by Sunday night**.

## 🚀 Tips

- Remember: *commit often, push regularly*.  
- If you run into GitHub or RStudio errors, take a screenshot so we can troubleshoot.  
- Don’t worry about making mistakes—the whole point is to practice!
