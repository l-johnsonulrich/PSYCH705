## Homework Instructions

Complete the exercises below using R Studio.
Type your code in the code chunks, then knit to HTML when you are finished.
Remember, practice builds muscle memory!

## Step 1: Load the Data

Load the data "mtcars" into your workspace. 
Convert it to a tibble and give the tibble a new shorter/easier name.  

```{r}


```

## Step 2: Summarize the Data

Get a sense of the structure and descriptive statistics. Run at least two functions here to "explore" the dataset. 

```{r}


```

## Step 3: Practice Database Commands

From Week 1, we learned to select specific rows and columns using [,] or $.
Try these examples:
```{r}
# Use square brackets to extract the 5th row and 3rd column.


# Extract rows 10–15 and columns 1–2 using both $ and square brackets. 


```

## Step 4: Using mutate to "save" the rownames as a new column
Use head() to view mtcars (original) and then print your tibble (if you type the name of your tibble it should automatically give you the top 10 rows without any additional functions. Notice that your tibble is missing the type of car to the left. In the original dataframe these were saved as "rownames" rather than part of the actual data. tibble() doesn't use rownames and so this data gets lost. 

Use mutate and the function rownames() to create a new column with the car types in your tibble. Be sure this new column is "saved" in your tibble. 
```{r}



```

## Step 5: Select only certain columns. 

Use ?mtcars to get some information about this dataset. Choose four columns that you want to explore and create a **new** tibble with just those four columns. 
Hint: Try ?dplyr::select for help here or use square brackets [,]. 
```{r}



```

## Step 7: Push to git! 
Save the .Rmd and .html files to the folder with your repo name on your computer.
Then sync your folder with your online repo.
